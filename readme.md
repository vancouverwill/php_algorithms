php_algorithms
==============

php_algorithms. I have implemented the methods here in PHP purely as a learning exercise.
I worked with the algorithms in http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ and to make sure I understood
them I have implemented and tested them in PHP.



TO DO 
============

-create compare sort to show difference in speed between different algorithms
-bottom up mergesort
-bubble sort
