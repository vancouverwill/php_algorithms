# Probability

## The four step method

Using intuition can cause a lot of mistakes with probability. The maths is very basic but you need to take the time to define the problem space.

1. Find the sample space.  A tree diagram can be really useful at this stage to draw out all the possibilities.

2. Define Events of Interest. To answer a question of the form "What is the probability that .....?" we need to determine which outcomes are part of the EVENT we are interested in.

3. Determine Outcome Probabilities. Each step on the tree determine the probability of it's outcome.
    3a. Assign Edge Probabilities
    3b. Compute Outcome Probabilities

4. Compute Event Probabilities
