# Bloom Filters

Fast inserts and lookups

Compared to hash tables.
## pros
are they are more  space efficient,
## cons
1) can't store an associated object
2) no deletions
3) small false positive probability (i.e., might say x has been inserted even though it hasnâ€™t been)


Applications
spell checkers, list of forbidden passwords, network routers (limited memory and need to be super fast)
