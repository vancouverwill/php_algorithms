A binary search  tree is either:
・Empty.
・Two disjoint binary trees (left and right).

Symmetric order. Each node has a key, and every node’s key is:
・Larger than all keys in its left subtree. ・Smaller than all keys in its right subtree.

Binary Search Trees enforce this order, binary trees don't necessarily enforce
