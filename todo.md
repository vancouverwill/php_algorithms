============

* angleBetweenClockHands
* red black tree
* keyIndexedCounting
* LSD
* MSD
* cluster algorithm
* test KosarajuSCCnonRecursive - explain what exactly about this is so slow


* review final exam for algorithms course. starting from question 13
* expand notes
* switch all PHP arrays out to more precise and less memory extensive SPL data structure such as splarray, splqueue etc
* boggle game using recursive approach and non recursive approach (http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ib/Classes/CS242_Winter09-10/Week2/Week2.pdf)
* Randomized Selection - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3XKGFObI4 in QuickFindIndexInUnsortedArray
* create compare view to show difference in speed between different algorithms
* bubble sort
* binary heap sort
* implement strassen's matrix calculation
* understand and implement the closest pair problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem) and (http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs251/ClosestPair/ClosestPairDQ.html)
* test topological ordering on graph which has no topological ordering to see result
